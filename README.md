# Cloud Computing - Assignment 1

The application developed for this Assignment was the Add-A-Reminder manager application. The application allows the users to register and/or login, based on if they have an existing account or not. Once they have successfully signed in, they are redirected to the home page to add or remove reminders, if they already exist. They will be able to add new  reminders, adding a date and description with it. If needed, they can also remove certain reminders, as they see fit.

It was built using NodeJS and Express, with Postgres as the database service, and SQL commands creating and modifying its contents, as per the needs. For the following assignment, the application was hosted on the cloud service, Heroku, with Postgres working through it to handle with the database servicing.
