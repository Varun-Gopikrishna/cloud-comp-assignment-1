## Description
Being a student is a hurdle. With our heavy courseloads, long assignments, and last minute submissions, there is not enough time to physically buy
something to eat, or drink. 

In response, we created the application that solves this issue, the BringMeFood app. This app allows the individuals to either play the role of a wanter, the person requesting for food, or a bringer, the person buying the food. The wanter would be required to create a food order, and once done, would be required to either send the desired order to bringers nearby based on his/her location or based on the custom code provided by the bringer. A payment option would allow the wanter to pay for their order. Once this is done, the desired location of set and the wanter can get ready to receive the food from the set location
